# Lab 1 : Photographer's Website

For this lab, you will create a basic website for a photographer using
HTML and CSS. The website you build must include:

* A menu that appears on all pages.

* A footer that appears on all pages, which includes the URL to your
  GitHub repository on GitHub classroom. This should be a private
  repository that only you and the TAs can access.

* A home page that introduces the viewer to the photographer, using
  a large image.

* A portfolio page that showcases 9 or 10 images from the
  photographer, using a CSS Grid layout to put them into a
  grid.

* A reviews page that lists reviews from customers, each in a separate
  paragraph and using styles to separate them (white space, lines,
  etc.).

* An about page that includes a photo of the photographer and tells the
  visitor a little about him or her.

* A contact page with a form that will let a visitor email the photographer
  to ask questions or setup an appointment.

There are many photographer web pages you can find with Google. Here
is an example of a basic page with some of the features you will
create: [http://www.jocilynmccleve.com/](http://www.jocilynmccleve.com/).

In most professional projects you are expected to use original images
or images that are licensed for use with [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licensing. You should do the
same here. You can find images on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/) or on [Creative
Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/) that are licensed with
the Creative Commons license.

## Starting the lab

To start the lab, you **must** follow this [GitHub Classroom
link](https://classroom.github.com/a/rm4yMOLS). This will create a private repository for you using our
classroom site. We will only grade repositories created and submitted
this way.

Once you "Accept the assignment" on github classroom, it will create a
new repository for you and grant you access to it on github. In order
to start working on the lab, simply clone the repository to your laptop
or other working environment.

## CSS Grid layout

To learn how to make a simple grid, see [this article on getting
started](https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid/) and see
[this tutorial](http://cssgridgarden.com/). You make also like [this
tutorial at
Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout).

## Contact form

To make a contact form, you should use the service at
[formspree.io](https://formspree.io/). This will let you make a simple
form that you can submit using their web server, and they will send
you email every time someone fills out the form.

If you would like to learn more about forms, see [this tutorial at
Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form).

## Web design criteria

When judging the style of pages, we will use the web design principles
discussed on in the [Web Design Principles](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/1753/pages/web-design-principles) page on Canvas. These include:

* Usability
* Navigation
* Focus
* Spacing
* Color
* Graphics
* Typography
* Alignment
* Consistency
* Mobile First
* Engagement

We will *not* be judging mobile first (responsive) design for this
lab.

## Submission

Submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your
DigitalOcean server.

## Rubric for Grading

When we grade these labs, we will award points using the following
rubric:

Item | Points
--- | ---
Has sufficient HTML content on every page (10 points per page) | 50
Has a working contact form | 30
Uses good web design principles | 20
